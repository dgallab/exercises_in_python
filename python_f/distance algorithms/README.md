These are algorithms designed for finding shortest distances, or steps, from one node to another. 

So far, I have included 3 algorithms:

1. dijkstra algorithm
2. Bellman-Ford (a variation of dijkstra)
3. friend connections (a hacker rank problem I successfully completed, in which the distance from one friend to another is always 1, and the goal is to find the shortest distance from one friend to another.
